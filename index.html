        <p class="bikep"> My favorite hobby is riding my bike because sometimes I get to ride my bike with my friends! I usally go outside after exercising because where I live, it's really cold and when I workout inside, it gets really hot so I go outside to get fresh air from the cold. I also like going outside on my bike because it's fun. There is a big hill from the top culdesac to the bottem culdesac. I go so fast and it's so fun.

            Riding a bike isn't that hard! It still takes some practice though. I started scootering a lot and when you bike, you have to balance on the bike, and on a scooter it's easier to balance on. So I started scootering, then I went on a bike and it was so much easier to bike instead of learning for a long time.</p>
